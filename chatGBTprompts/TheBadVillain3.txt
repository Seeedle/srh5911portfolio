Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there lived a villain named Zorgon. He had always dreamed of being a powerful and feared ruler, but unfortunately for him, he was terrible at his job.

Zorgon would spend hours coming up with elaborate plans to take over the kingdom, but they always seemed to fall apart at the last minute. He would send his minions to carry out his nefarious schemes, but they would often return empty-handed or with ridiculous excuses for their failures.

One day, Zorgon decided to put his latest plan into action. He had developed a powerful potion that would turn anyone who drank it into a loyal follower. He sent his minions out to the local taverns and inns to slip the potion into the drinks of unsuspecting travelers. But instead of turning into loyal followers, the people who drank the potion became violently ill, and the taverns and inns banned Zorgon's minions from returning.

Zorgon's next plan was to create an army of robots to take over the kingdom. He spent all his savings on the parts and machinery to build them. But on the day of the robot uprising, his creations fell apart as soon as they were activated, leaving him standing alone, embarrassed and broke in front of his minions.

As time went on, Zorgon's plans became increasingly desperate and harebrained. He tried to create a giant laser to destroy the castle, but it wouldn't even turn on. He attempted to dig a tunnel under the castle but ended up just digging a hole in his own backyard.

The kingdom laughed at him, and even his own minions began to lose faith. Zorgon became a joke, the punchline of every tavern story. In the end, he was forced to give up his evil ways and instead found a more suitable job as a court jester for the King, entertaining the people with his failed attempt at villainy.

Moral of the story, being bad at your job can lead to unexpected and unwanted results.
