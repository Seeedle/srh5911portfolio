            <p> After working with and getting used to both different websites editors,the difference between the two are abundantly clear. Its is much easier using sites PSU than it is GitHub Pages. PSU sites is more accessible for beginner coders. It is slightly restrictive with the type of adjustments, but os still a decent editor. GitHub is a harder tool to use, becuase it doesn't put everything in front of you. It gives the coder much more creative freedom than PSU sites. Creating a website with GitHub is a very tedious process, but is very rewarding. </p>
            <br/>
            <p> The skills you'd require to be able to use the  web editors, surprisingly, aren't the same. For PSU sites, you could basically build a website without any knowledge of how to code. GitHub needs a more experienced individual to build their website.</p>
            <br/>
            <p> Both web Editors are fantastic tools to build websites, but I prefer GitHub due to the flexibility it has when dealing with design. Moving forward, I plan on growing my understanding on CSS code as well as work on my organization.</p>
